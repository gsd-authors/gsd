# gsd
Reference implementation of generalised score distribution in python

This library provides a reference implementation of gsd probabilities for correctness and efficient implementation of samples and log_probabilities in `jax`. 

### Citations

Theoretical derivation of GSD is described in the following paper.

If you decide to apply the concepts presented or base on the provided code, please do refer our related paper.

### Fancy math

In order to keep the reference implementation as close to the math as possible we define some utilities with unicode symbols.
E.g.  `ùö∑(i for i in ‚Ñ§[1,3])` is a valid python code for $$\prod_{i=1}^{3} i$$




## Installation

You can install gsd via `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install ref_gsd
```



## Development

To develop and modify gsd, you need to install
[`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/), a tool for Python packaging and
dependency management.

To install the development dependencies of gsd, you can run

```bash
$ poetry install
```

and to enter a virtual environment for testing or debugging, you can run:

```bash
$ poetry shell
```

### Running tests

Gsd uses [Pytest](https://pytest.org/) for testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

```
$ poetry run pytest tests
```
